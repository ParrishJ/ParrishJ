### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jared - Iâ€™m curious, thoughtful, and always looking to learn more. I enjoy solving complex problems with modern web technology and implementing aesthetically pleasing web design. I have a passion for working with technology across the webstack and specialize in using HTML, CSS, SCSS / LESS,  and JavaScript along with various frameworks and libraries. 

Some of my favorite front end technologies to work with include:

* React
* Redux
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap 
* React Bootstrap
* LESS  / SCSS
* Tailwind CSS 

Some back end technologies I enjoy working with include:

* Node.js / express.js
* knex.js
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite

Iâ€™m always looking to learn and create new things and aim to add new projects to GitHub on a regular basis. 

Thanks for stopping by!
